## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- In this project I was able to improve my handling of CSS, such as the understanding of the box-model, the use of flexbox, how to import fonts directly to the css file. I also reinforced knowledge of box positioning and responsible units of measurement.

- Much knowledge gained about Git and Github.

### Continued development

- I must continue to reinforce all the knowledge used in this project and learn new ways to improve my code.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me throughout the learning.
